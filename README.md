## üîß Installation

SmartSense requires Python 3.9+ and can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install smartsense
```

For development installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaronjacobs-chelt/SmartSense.git
cd SmartSense
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## üîç Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started with SmartSense:

```python
from smartsense import SensorNetwork
from smartsense.sensors.base import TemperatureSensor, HumiditySensor

# Create a sensor network
network = SensorNetwork(name="Home Environment")

# Add some sensors
network.add_sensor(TemperatureSensor(
    name="Living Room Temperature",
    update_interval=2.0,
    min_value=18.0,
    max_value=26.0,
))

network.add_sensor(HumiditySensor(
    name="Living Room Humidity",
    update_interval=3.0,
    min_value=30.0,
    max_value=60.0,
))

# Configure an alert
network.add_alert(
    sensor_id="temperature_abc123",  # Use the actual sensor ID
    field="temperature",
    operator="gt",                   # greater than
    value=25.0,                      # 25¬∞C threshold
    actions=[("activate_cooling", lambda: print("Cooling activated!"))],
    alert_name="High Temperature Alert",
)

# Start the network
network.running = True

# In a real application, you would run the network in the background
# See examples/demo.py for a complete example
```

## üîå Supported Sensors

SmartSense supports a wide range of sensors, including:

### Environmental Sensors
- Temperature & Humidity (DHT11, DHT22, BME280)
- Pressure (BMP180, BMP280, BME680)
- Light (TSL2561, BH1750)
- Air Quality (MQ-135, CCS811, SGP30)

### Motion & Presence
- PIR Motion (HC-SR501)
- Ultrasonic Distance (HC-SR04)
- Infrared Proximity

### Water & Soil
- Water Level Sensors
- Flow Meters
- Soil Moisture
- pH Sensors

### Custom Sensors
SmartSense provides an extensible framework for adding custom sensor types by subclassing the `Sensor` base class.

## üß† Architecture

SmartSense is built on a modular, event-driven architecture that allows for flexible deployment options:

- **Core Monitoring System**: Central nervous system that manages sensor connections, data collection, and event processing
- **Sensor Abstraction Layer**: Provides a unified interface for different sensor types and hardware
- **Alert System**: Configurable alert conditions and actions based on sensor data
- **REST API**: HTTP-based interface for external integration
- **Data Storage**: Pluggable storage backends for sensor readings and configuration

## üõ†Ô∏è Extending SmartSense

SmartSense is designed to be easily extensible:

### Adding New Sensor Types

```python
from smartsense.sensors.base import Sensor, SensorReading
from typing import Optional

class MyCustomReading(SensorReading):
    value: float
    unit: str = "units"

class MyCustomSensor(Sensor):
    async def initialize(self) -> bool:
        # Initialize hardware or connections
        self._initialized = True
        return True
    
    async def read(self) -> Optional[SensorReading]:
        # Read data from the sensor
        value = 42.0  # Replace with actual reading
        
        reading = MyCustomReading(
            sensor_id=self.id,
            value=value
        )
        
        self._last_reading = reading
        self._last_read_time = time.time()
        
        return reading
```

### Creating Custom Alert Actions

```python
def my_custom_alert_action():
    # Custom action when alert is triggered
    print("Alert triggered! Taking action...")
    # Control hardware, send notification, etc.

# Add to a sensor network
network.add_alert(
    sensor_id="my_sensor_id",
    field="value",
    operator="gt",
    value=threshold_value,
    actions=[("my_custom_action", my_custom_alert_action)],
)
```

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to SmartSense:

### Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs, please include:

- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior and what actually happened
- SmartSense version and Python version
- Any relevant logs or error messages

Use the GitHub issue tracker with the "bug" label.

### Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are always welcome! Please provide:

- A clear description of the feature
- Why this feature would be beneficial
- Any relevant examples or use cases

Use the GitHub issue tracker with the "enhancement" label.

### Code Contributions

We welcome code contributions through pull requests. Before writing code, please:

1. Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicating work
2. For significant changes, open an issue first to discuss your approach
3. Follow the coding standards and testing requirements

### Documentation Improvements

Documentation is crucial for any project. Improvements can include:

- Fixing typos or clarifying existing documentation
- Adding examples or tutorials
- Translating documentation to other languages
- Creating diagrams or visual aids

## Development Environment Setup

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/SmartSense.git
   cd SmartSense
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```
5. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Coding Standards

We follow these coding standards to maintain code quality and consistency:

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) standards
- Use [Google's docstring format](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)
- Maximum line length is 88 characters (compatible with Black)
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values

### Code Formatting

We use the following tools to enforce code style:

- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting
- [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for style guide enforcement
- [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking

You can run all these tools with pre-commit:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line
- Consider using the following prefixes:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `test:` for test-related changes
  - `refactor:` for refactoring existing code
  - `style:` for formatting changes
  - `chore:` for routine tasks and maintenance

## Testing Requirements

All code contributions must include appropriate tests:

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request
- Aim for at least 90% test coverage for new code
- Run the test suite with:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
- For coverage report:
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=src/smartsense --cov-report=term
  ```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Branch naming**: Use a descriptive branch name following this pattern:
   - `feature/short-description` for new features
   - `bugfix/issue-description` for bug fixes
   - `docs/description` for documentation-only changes
   - `refactor/description` for refactoring

2. **Keep changes focused**: Each PR should address a single concern. If you have multiple unrelated changes, submit separate PRs.

3. **Submit your PR**: Fill out the PR template completely, including:
   - A clear description of what the PR does
   - Any related issues it addresses (use "Fixes #123" or "Relates to #123")
   - Changes you made
   - How to test the changes

4. **Code review process**:
   - Maintainers will review your code and may suggest changes
   - Address any review comments and push additional commits to your branch
   - Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

5. **After PR approval**:
   - Your changes will be merged into the main branch
   - You can delete your branch if you want

## Security Policy

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do **NOT** open a public issue. Instead:

1. Email us at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with details
2. Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability
3. Allow time for us to address the issue before disclosing it publicly

We take security issues seriously and will work quickly to address any vulnerabilities.

## Community Guidelines

To foster a positive and inclusive community, please:

- **Be respectful**: Treat everyone with respect and kindness, regardless of their background or experience level
- **Be constructive**: Offer constructive feedback and focus on the ideas, not the person presenting them
- **Stay on topic**: Keep discussions relevant to SmartSense development
- **Help others learn**: If you have expertise, share it with others who are learning
- **Give credit**: Acknowledge others' contributions and ideas
- **Follow the code of conduct**: Adhere to our community standards

### Communication Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports, feature requests, and specific technical discussions
- **GitHub Discussions**: For general questions, ideas, and community conversation
- **GitHub Wiki**: For collaborative documentation
